  {
    "name": "Metamerism",
    "definition": "The different appearance of color under different light sources. See: <a href='https: //www.carboline.com/solution-spot/posts/understanding-metamerism-color-matching-for-industrial-coatings/'>Understanding Metamerism</a>."
  },
  {
    "name": "Surface Tolerant",
    "definition": "A coating that is tolerant of less than ideal surface preparation."
  },
  {
    "name": "Moisture Tolerant",
    "definition": "A coating that cures and adheres to damp surfaces. It can get wet before full cure."
  },
  {
    "name": "Mix Ratio",
    "definition": "Typically the ratio by volume of Part A to Part B. Some coatings have more components - Parts C, D, etc."
  },
  {
    "name": "Fisheye",
    "definition": "Separation and/or wet film pulling apart, exposing the coating or substrate beneath. Often caused by contamination on substrate (silicone, oil, grease, water etc.), incompatible coatings (latex and/or waterborne coatings over silicone) or coating over sealants prior to their proper cure."
  },
  {
    "name": "Wrinkling",
    "definition": "A rough, crinkled surface. It is often caused by the top surface of coating drying faster than the underlying coating, excessive film build, or application when it s too hot or windy. It most commonly occurs with oil-based (alkyd) coatings that are too thick."
  },
  {
    "name": "Pinpoint Rusting",
    "definition": "Rusting at pinholes, holidays, valleys, or low spots in the coating. It is often caused by pinholes exposing the substrate, insufficient coating thickness, or a surface profile too deep for a coating to sufficiently cover peaks. It is sometimes seen with WB primers or DTM s that can not overcome surface contaminants."
